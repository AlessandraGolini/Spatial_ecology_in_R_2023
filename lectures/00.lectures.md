Satellite images can indeed be represented as matrices of numbers. Each pixel in a satellite image corresponds to a specific location on the Earth's surface, and the **color or intensity of that pixel** can be **represented by numerical values**. These numerical values typically represent **attributes such as brightness, reflectance, or temperature**.

A satellite image is usually composed of multiple bands or channels, each capturing data at a specific wavelength. For example, satellite sensors might capture data in the visible spectrum (red, green, blue), as well as in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum such as infrared or thermal bands. **Each band contributes to a separate layer or "band" in the image**.

To represent a satellite image as a matrix of numbers, each pixel in the image is assigned a numerical value for each band. Therefore, the image can be represented as a three-dimensional matrix, with dimensions corresponding to the image width, image height, and the number of bands.
Each element of the matrix would contain the numerical value corresponding to the intensity or color of the pixel at that location and in that band.
