the boundaries between biomes or land cover or land use classes on maps are not as neat and clean in real life.”
On the ground, ecosystems often fade gradually into each other, or there can be variations within a patch of land. “The key thing to remember is that the Amazon basin is an extremely diverse place, it includes the rainforest biome—Amazonia—as well as Cerrado. And Cerrado itself is a broad term. It can include dry forests, savannas, shrublands, all the way to grasslands with very few trees at all.”

In some cases, the nuances can be lost on a continental-scale map. For instance, land cleared for crops and pasture along a deforestation frontier in Rondônia (a state in Brazil) appears to be a fairly continuous yellow area on the continental map at the top of the page. However, as seen in the more detailed view above, the area—which shows development extending into a seasonally flooded savanna near the border with Bolivia—is really a mixture of clearly defined pastures, fields, and forested stream banks of differing green, pink, and brown shades.

With seven successive satellites, **Landsat** has taken a snapshot of every part of the Amazon rainforest every two weeks for 47 years, creating the **world’s longest, most consistent record of change in the region**. Most Landsat satellites have collected 30-meter images, with each pixel representing an area about the size of a baseball field—enough to detect even relatively small clearings and fires. Poring through these many thousands of images of the Amazon, scientists have used the data to analyze everything from how roads have spread, to how the size of cleared parcels has changed, to how deforestation has altered the water cycle.

Remote-sensed deforestation alerts provide high-frequency information on tree cover loss in the Amazon. However, these alerts often do not reach immediately impacted populations.
