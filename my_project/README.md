1. INTRODUCTION
   + This project aims to delve into the causes behind the significant reduction experienced by the Amazon forest over the last two decades and shed light on the critical role of indigenous populations in protecting this vital ecosystem.
   + some spatial and statistical analysis were carried out:
      + Analyses of the distribution of indigenous territories,
      + As well as of the protected natural areas of the Amazon,
      + In parallel with the deforestation map relative to the period 2000-2020.
   + Subsequently, based on the temporal frequency distribution of deforestation events, the analysis focused on one of the most deforested parts of the Amazon: the state of Rondonia in western Brazil, paying attention to Vegetation Cover indices (2000-2012).
